The error message suggests that the PowerShell execution policy on your system is preventing you from running scripts like nodemon. The default execution policy on Windows is set to "Restricted," which prevents any scripts from running. You can change the execution policy to allow running scripts by following these steps:

Open PowerShell as an administrator.
Run the command Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned to set the execution policy to allow locally created scripts to run.
When prompted, type Y to confirm the change.
