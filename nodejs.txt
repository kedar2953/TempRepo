window in browser 
    when you open a web page in a browser, the browser creates a window to display the contents of the page. The window object in JavaScript represents that window, and provides access to many built-in functions to interact with the browser and the web page.

    window.alert() function to display a popup message with some text

    window object is a top-level object in JavaScript that represents the global environment in which your code is executing

IN node we have GLOBALS , no window because there is no browser , anywhere in our application we can access them
